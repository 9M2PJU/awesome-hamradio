### SDR

+ [GNU Radio](https://github.com/gnuradio/gnuradio) a software development toolkit that provides signal processing blocks to implement software radios.
+ [gqrx](https://github.com/csete/gqrx) is an open source software defined radio (SDR) receiver implemented using GNU Radio and the Qt GUI toolkit.
+ [linhpsdr](https://github.com/g0orx/linhpsdr) linux hpsdr software.
  + [pihpsdr](https://github.com/g0orx/pihpsdr) Raspberry Pi 3 standalone code for HPSDR

### Antennas

### Logging

+ [CQRLOG](https://github.com/ok2cqr/cqrlog) an advanced ham radio logger based on MySQL database.
+ [PyQSO](https://github.com/ctjacobs/pyqso) is a contact logging tool for amateur radio operators.

### Digimodes

+ [WSJT](https://sourceforge.net/projects/wsjt/) five programs designed for amateur radio communication
  + **WSJT:** Modes optimized for meteor scanner, ionospheric scatter, and EME at VHF/UHF/Microwaves.
  + **WSJT-X:** Modes JT65, JT9. Primarily for use at HF.
  + **MAP65:** For EME an VHF and higher frequencies. Implements a panoramic, polarization-matching receiver for JT65.
  + **WSPR:** Probe potential propagation paths using low-power transmissions.
  + **WSPR-X:** Experimental version of WSPR, including the slow mode WSPR-15.

+ [fldigi](https://sourceforge.net/projects/fldigi/) is a modem program for most of the digital modes used by radio amateurs today.

### Libraries

+ [Hamlib](https://github.com/Hamlib/Hamlib) libraries for amateur radio equipment control applications.
+ [pyhamtools](https://github.com/dh1tw/pyhamtools ) is a set of functions and classes for Amateur Radio purposes.

## Hardware

+ [MMDVM](https://github.com/g4klx/MMDVM) Multi-Mode Digital Voice Modem
  + [MMDVM_HS_HAT](https://github.com/mathisschmieder/MMDVM_HS_Hat) for the Raspberry Pi (Zero)

+ [HPSDR](http://openhpsdr.org/) a hardware and software project intended as a "next generation" Software Defined Radio (SDR) for use by Radio Amateurs.
